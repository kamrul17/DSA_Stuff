Time complexity: Rate of which time taken increases with respect to input size;
1.worst case scenerio
2.avoid constant
3.avoid lower value.

space complexity: auxilliary space (space that you take to solve the problem) + input space( the spacen that you take tp store the input).
example:
a=1,b=2
c=a+b
here a and b are input space and c is auxiliary space.
